# Deep Humor Recognition Project

*Posted with permission from instructor.*

**Authors/Creators:** Matthew Liechty and N. Lee

Based on the paper [Humor Detection in Yelp reviews](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/OliveiraLuke.pdf) by Luke de Oliveira and Alfredo Lainez Rodrigo of Stanford University.

The write up for this project and its results can be viewed [here](project_paper.pdf).

The code written to generate the results for this project (besides some of the data pre-processing code) is available in the Jupyter Notebook [project_code.ipynb](project_code.ipynb).

In this project we use a wide variety of neural network approaches to learning humor from Yelp data. Approaches include feedforward neural networks, bidirectional LSTMS, bidirectional GRUs, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
